If you choose to submit this project using your library libft, it is strictly FORBIDDEN
to bypass the limitation of the Norm by adding some specific functions from your
get_next_line. That would be considered cheating during your defence. Your
get_next_line must hold in 5 functions of 25 lines max. The respect of this
instruction will be carefully checked during your defence. There is no need for you
ask permission to the staff to add a function to your library. Use your head instead
and ask yourself if your function respects this instruction. If you do everything right,
you will of course be encouraged to expand your library with generic functions.
Youâ€™ll discover their usage as you complete this project
